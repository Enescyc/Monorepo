## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
```typescript
// File Naming
feature.component.tsx
feature.service.ts
feature.module.ts
feature.types.ts

// Component Structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = () => {
  // Component implementation
}

// Service Structure
@Injectable()
export class FeatureService {
  // Service implementation
}
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Branch Naming
feature/feature-name
bugfix/issue-description
hotfix/urgent-fix
release/version-number

# Commit Messages
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
chore: update dependencies
docs: update documentation
```
